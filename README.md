What is object-oriented programming?

- Ruby is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language r P describes a category of languages.
- The OOP paradigm views a program as a collection of objects that communicate with one another.
- An object is a digital data structure. It's a container that stores data and provides ways â€¢ access and manipulate that data.
- In Ruby, everything is an object

Variables and Constants

- A variable is a name we assign to a value in our program. The variable's value can change as the program runs.
- A constant is a name for a value that will not change over the program's execution. Use ALL CAPS for constants.
- Choose a name, then write the equal sign, and the value on the right hand side.
- Ruby evaluates the right-hand side of an equal sign first. Thus, we can assign a variable or constant to the result of an evaluation.
